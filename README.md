# High-order-quantum-trajectory-simulation
This is Python scripts for simulating quantum trajectory using higher-order methods in literature.

There are two parts of this project. 
The first part is to run the script "True_Data_Generation.py" to generate the true states and coarse-grained records. 

The second part is to run the script "Trajectory_simulation.py", where the existing methods is used to simulate quantum trajectory conditioned on the records previously generated by the first script. The trace distance alanysis is also included in this script.

To obtain the results for different settings, one needs to change the forms of the measurement operator and their corresponding intitial state. The data from each case is stored in different folders.
