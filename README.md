# High-order-quantum-trajectory-simulation
This is Python scripts for simulating quantum trajectory and showing the results for The histrograms.

There are two parts. 
The first part is to run the script "True_Data_Generation.py" to generate the true trajectories and the coarse-grained records, I_t and \phi_t. 

The second part is to run the script "Trajectory_simulation.py", where the existing methods are used to simulate quantum trajectory conditioned on the coarse-grained records previously generated by the first script. The trace distance alanysis is also included in this script.

To obtain the results for different measurement processes, one needs to change the forms of the measurement operator and their corresponding intitial states as provided in the scripts.

Details for simulation cases.
Case 1. Use operator $\hat c = \sqrt{\gamma/2}\hat \sigma_z$ with the initial state |+x> for spin 1/2 system.
Case 2. Use operator \hat c = \sqrt{\gamma}\hat \sigma_- with the initial state |+x> for spin 1/2 system.
Case 3. Use operator \hat c = \sqrt{\gamma}\hat \sigma_- with the initial state |+x> for spin 1 system.
Case 4. Use operator \hat c = \sqrt{\gamma}\hat \sigma_- with the initial state |+x> for spin 3/2 system.
Case 5. Use operator \hat c = \sqrt{\gamma/2}\hat \sigma_z with the initial state |+x> for spin 1 system.
